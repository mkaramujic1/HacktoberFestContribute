Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.

"graph.h" consists of the declarations of the functions that are required for implementing the dijkstra and krushkal alorithm

"func.cpp" consists of the function defnitions that are declared in the graph.h

"graph.cpp" shows a sample implementation of the code for dijkstra and krushkal and makefile that is required is also uploaded.
